# Bablos Biscuit Hunt! -The game

## ðŸ’¡ Introduction

Just a small practice with Python and Pygame -library.

The game was initially developed using the PyGame Zero -library, which is a beginner-friendly way to get into game development with Python. This was made possible by some easy-to-use features and by running the program without a traditional game loop. However, at some point, the limitations of PyGame Zero became apparent, so the game switched to using the actual PyGame library, which is a very popular game development module.

## ðŸ¦‹ Story and game 
### Story

We have a beloved dog named Bablo. Bablo is a Labrador Retriever, and she loves biscuits like other labs do. That inspired me to create a simple game in Python, which was an ideal project for learning Python and Pygame.

### Game

The idea is simple: just guide Bablo to collect as many biscuits as you can. If you catch a biscuit, you get one point, and if you miss one, you lose one life.

Note that even though Bablo loves delicacies, he wonâ€™t eat just anything. You lose points if you collect something that Bablo doesnâ€™t like. If you collect a carrot, you lose 1 point, and if you collect an olive, you lose 2 points because he hates olives.

And it's been said that there are also some poisoned sausages around. If you accidentally collect a poisoned sausage, the game will end immediately.

## ðŸŽ® Playing

Game controller is keyboard. Move player with Left, Right, Up and Down arrow keys. Quit to starting screen by hitting ESC -key, and quit game by pressing Q-key.
Collect biscuits and avoid letting them to fall out. Avoid carrots, olives and poisoned sausages.
