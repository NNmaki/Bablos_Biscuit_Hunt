## Story and game

Story

We have a beloved dog named Bablo. Bablo is a Labrador Retriever, and she loves biscuits like other labs do. That inspired me to create a simple game in Python, which was an ideal project for learning Python and Pygame.

Game

The idea is simple: just guide Bablo to collect as many biscuits as you can. If you catch a biscuit, you get one point, and if you miss one, you lose one life.

Note that even though Bablo loves delicacies, he won’t eat just anything. You lose points if you collect something that Bablo doesn’t like. If you collect a carrot, you lose 1 point, and if you collect an olive, you lose 2 points because he hates olives.

And it's been said that there are also some poisoned sausages around. If you accidentally collect a poisoned sausage, the game will end immediately.

Happy playing!
